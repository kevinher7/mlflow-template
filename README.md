# MLFlow Template with Poetry

This is a template repo that contains a barebones structure for machine learning projects using MLFlow for experiment tracking and poetry for package management

# Installation

1. Fork the repo
2. Run `poetry install` to get the base dependencies
3. Use mlflow ui with `mlflow ui`

# TODO

- Add docker compose for easy mlflow setup
- Create some sort of poetry scripts?
